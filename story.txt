Chapter- 1
Once upon a time there lived 2 friends named Cassy and Katie. The world they lived in was getting attacked by many zombies. They were everywhere. Katie and Cassy ran into their tree house and hid in there for months. After a while they thought why not just go out and see how to world is now.

Both of them stepped out of the tree house and saw many zombies and everything was burned down. “We have missed a lot! Look at this place! It’s all burned down!” said Katie. “Yeah… Want to look around? We need to be really careful while walking around because there are so many zombies! We don’t want to be zombie food! Eww!” said Cassy. “Yes, let’s do it! First I’ll go down then you come behind me.” Said Katie. They both climbed down the tree house ladder slowly.
