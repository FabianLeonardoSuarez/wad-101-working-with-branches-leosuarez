Chapter- 1
Once upon a time there lived 2 friends named Cassy and Katie. The world they lived in was getting attacked by many zombies. They were everywhere. Katie and Cassy ran into their tree house and hid in there for months. After a while they thought why not just go out and see how to world is now.

“Wow! It is really empty out here! I wonder if we are the last people in this world!” said Cassy. “Well, we might be! Let’s look around!” said Katie. “I can see no-one at all here! It actually feels like we are the last humans here!” said Cassy. “Yeah! There is no-one here! I will go to all the stores and Cassy go to all the restaurants!” said Katie. “I am hungry so sure!” said Cassy. “Come on! You’re not eating any food there! You never know, it can have poison in it!” said Katie. “Yeah, yeah. I won’t!” said Cassy. “Okay! Now let’s start! Call me if you find anything!” said Katie.
