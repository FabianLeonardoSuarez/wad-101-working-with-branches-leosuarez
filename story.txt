Chapter- 1
Once upon a time there lived 2 friends named Cassy and Katie. The world they lived in was getting attacked by many zombies. They were everywhere. Katie and Cassy ran into their tree house and hid in there for months. After a while they thought why not just go out and see how to world is now.

Both of them quietly walked away to explore how their world looked now. Cassy walked into a restaurant. All she could see is food on the walls, floor and ceiling! Just then she hears a noise! “Ouch! Ouch!” it said. Cassy slowly walked towards that sound and saw a huge caterpillar on the ground. “A-a-are you okay?” she asked politely. “Not really… One of the zombie bit me and it hurts a lot! I thought that this is a safe place to come and relax.” Said the huge caterpillar. “Oh! That’s bad! I have some medicines in my bag! Do you mind if I put one of them on you?” asked Cassy. “Oh yes sure! Thank you!” said the huge caterpillar. Cassy takes out a cream and gently puts it on the caterpillar’s body. “It feels much better now! Thank you so much! What’s your name?” said the huge caterpillar. “Oh no problem! I’m Cassy!” said Cassy. “I need to go now! I’m happy I helped you! Bye!!” said Cassy and left.

“Wow! It is really empty out here! I wonder if we are the last people in this world!” said Cassy. “Well, we might be! Let’s look around!” said Katie. “I can see no-one at all here! It actually feels like we are the last humans here!” said Cassy. “Yeah! There is no-one here! I will go to all the stores and Cassy go to all the restaurants!” said Katie. “I am hungry so sure!” said Cassy. “Come on! You’re not eating any food there! You never know, it can have poison in it!” said Katie. “Yeah, yeah. I won’t!” said Cassy. “Okay! Now let’s start! Call me if you find anything!” said Katie.
